# Feature Specification: Organization Management Dialog

**Feature Branch**: `001-org-management-add`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "org management - add a new dialog under the profile where the user can make changes to the organisation if he's admin. The admin may change the name of the organization. only add a very simple dialog to the web and not for the api at all"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an organization administrator, I want to access a management dialog from my profile page so that I can update my organization's name and other settings. use the existing tables, services and repositories of the organization. Primarily add changes to the web layer the rest should be fine.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an organization administrator, **When** I navigate to my profile page, **Then** I should see an "Organization Settings" or "Manage Organization" option in the menu of my profile.
2. **Given** I am on the organization management dialog, **When** I change the organization name and save, **Then** the organization name should be updated throughout the system
3. **Given** I am a regular user (not admin), **When** I navigate to my profile page, **Then** I should not see organization management options
4. **Given** I am on the organization management dialog, **When** I cancel my changes, **Then** the dialog should close without saving changes
5. **Given** I am on the organization management dialog, **When** I submit an empty organization name, **Then** I should see a validation error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a non-admin user tries to access the organization management URL directly?
- How does the system handle concurrent organization name changes by multiple admins?
- What happens if the organization name is changed while other users are viewing organization-related pages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide access to organization management dialog only to users with administrator privileges
- **FR-002**: System MUST display organization management option in the user profile area for administrators
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow administrators to modify the organization name through a simple dialog interface
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate organization name input (non-empty, reasonable length limits)
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist organization name changes immediately upon save
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent non-administrator users from accessing organization management functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear feedback when organization name is successfully updated
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to cancel organization name changes without saving
- **FR-009**: System MUST display current organization name in the management dialog
- **FR-010**: System MUST update organization name display across all relevant pages after successful change

### Key Entities
- **Organization**: Represents the organizational entity with attributes like name, settings, and administrator relationships
- **User**: Represents individual users with roles including administrator privileges for organization management
