# Research: Organization Management Dialog

## Technology Research

### Go Web Development with HTMX
**Decision**: Use existing HTMX + Bootstrap patterns for dialog implementation
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains consistency with existing codebase
- HTMX provides seamless dialog interactions without full page reloads
- Bootstrap provides proven modal/dialog components
- Server-side rendering aligns with existing architecture

**Alternatives considered**:
- React/Vue.js frontend: Rejected - would require significant architecture changes
- Plain JavaScript: Rejected - HTMX provides better integration with Go templates
- Full page forms: Rejected - dialog provides better UX for simple organization name change

### Go DDD Architecture Patterns
**Decision**: Follow existing layered architecture (presentation → domain → infrastructure)
**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing user module structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable domain logic
- Follows constitutional requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct database access from web layer: Rejected - violates DDD principles
- Monolithic service layer: Rejected - doesn't follow existing patterns

### Existing Organization Infrastructure
**Decision**: Leverage existing organization tables, repositories, and domain models
**Rationale**:
- Organizations table already exists with org_id and title fields
- OrganizationRepository interface already exists with InsertOrganization method
- Organization domain model already exists with ID and Title fields
- Minimal changes required to existing infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:
- New organization tables: Rejected - would duplicate existing infrastructure
- New repository interfaces: Rejected - existing interfaces sufficient
- New domain models: Rejected - existing models can be extended

### Database Schema Design
**Decision**: Use existing organizations table with title field for organization name
**Rationale**:
- Organizations table already exists with org_id and title fields
- Title field can be used for organization name
- No schema changes required
- Simple update operation for name changes

**Alternatives considered**:
- New organization_settings table: Rejected - over-engineering for single field
- JSON configuration field: Rejected - name is core entity attribute
- Schema migrations: Rejected - existing schema sufficient

### Authentication & Authorization
**Decision**: Use existing user role system to determine admin privileges
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing authentication infrastructure
- Consistent with current authorization patterns
- Simple role-based access control
- Users already have organization_id field

**Alternatives considered**:
- New permission system: Rejected - existing role system sufficient
- Organization-specific roles: Rejected - over-engineering for current needs

## Implementation Patterns

### Dialog Implementation
**Decision**: Use Bootstrap modal with HTMX for form submission
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing UI patterns
- HTMX handles form submission without page reload
- Bootstrap provides accessible modal implementation
- Server-side validation and feedback

### Form Validation
**Decision**: Server-side validation with HTMX response handling
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing form patterns
- Centralized validation logic in domain service
- Better security than client-side only validation

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Use HTMX response patterns for success/error feedback
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing error handling
- Seamless user experience
- Server-side error messages

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Comprehensive server-side validation
**Rationale**:
- Prevents malicious input
- Ensures data integrity
- Follows security best practices

### Authorization Checks
**Decision**: Verify admin privileges at both web and domain layers
**Rationale**:
- Defense in depth
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Consistent with existing patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Database Operations
**Decision**: Simple UPDATE operation for organization title
**Rationale**:
- Minimal database impact
- Single table update
- No complex queries required

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: No caching required for organization name
**Rationale**:
- Organization name changes infrequently
- Simple database operation
- No performance bottleneck expected

## Existing Infrastructure Analysis

### What Already Exists
- **Database**: Organizations table with org_id and title fields
- **Domain Model**: Organization struct with ID and Title fields
- **Repository**: OrganizationRepository interface with InsertOrganization method
- **Repository Implementations**: Database and in-memory repositories
- **User Integration**: Users have organization_id field

### What Needs to be Added
- **Service Layer**: Organization service for business logic and name updates
- **Web Interface**: Organization management dialog and handlers
- **Authorization**: Admin role checking for organization management
- **Validation**: Organization name validation and uniqueness checks

### Implementation Strategy
- **Minimal Changes**: Extend existing infrastructure rather than creating new
- **Service Layer**: Add organization service for business logic
- **Web Layer**: Add organization web handlers for user interface
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
