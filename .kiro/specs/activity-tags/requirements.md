# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to add tags to their tracked activities for better organization and categorization. Tags will be case-insensitive and provide autocomplete functionality to improve user experience and maintain consistency across the application. This enhancement will allow users to filter, search, and analyze their time tracking data more effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple tags to my activities, so that I can categorize and organize my time tracking entries for better analysis and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or edits an activity THEN the system SHALL provide a tag input field
2. WHEN a user enters tags THEN the system SHALL accept multiple tags separated by commas or spaces
3. WHEN a user saves an activity with tags THEN the system SHALL store all tags associated with that activity
4. WHEN a user views an activity THEN the system SHALL display all associated tags
5. IF a user enters duplicate tags on the same activity THEN the system SHALL store only unique tags

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want tags to be case-insensitive, so that "Meeting" and "meeting" are treated as the same tag to maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a tag with any case combination THEN the system SHALL normalize the tag to lowercase for storage
2. WHEN displaying tags THEN the system SHALL show tags in a consistent format (title case or lowercase)
3. WHEN comparing tags for uniqueness THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive comparison
4. WHEN filtering by tags THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive matching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want autocomplete functionality for tags, so that I can quickly select from previously used tags and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts typing in the tag input field THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with matching existing tags
2. WHEN a user selects a tag from the autocomplete dropdown THEN the system SHALL add the tag to the activity
3. WHEN displaying autocomplete suggestions THEN the system SHALL show tags that match the current input (case-insensitive)
4. WHEN no matching tags exist THEN the system SHALL allow the user to create a new tag
5. WHEN showing autocomplete suggestions THEN the system SHALL limit results to tags within the current user's organization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter my activities by tags, so that I can view only activities with specific tags for focused analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the activities list THEN the system SHALL provide a tag filter option
2. WHEN a user selects one or more tags for filtering THEN the system SHALL display only activities containing those tags
3. WHEN multiple tags are selected for filtering THEN the system SHALL show activities with any of the selected tags (OR logic)
4. WHEN a tag filter is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the filter state during pagination
5. WHEN clearing tag filters THEN the system SHALL display all activities again

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see tag usage statistics, so that I can understand how I'm categorizing my time and identify patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing reports THEN the system SHALL include tag-based grouping options
2. WHEN generating time reports THEN the system SHALL allow filtering and grouping by tags
3. WHEN displaying tag statistics THEN the system SHALL show total time spent per tag
4. WHEN viewing tag analytics THEN the system SHALL respect the user's organization boundaries
5. WHEN no activities have tags THEN the system SHALL handle empty tag data gracefully
