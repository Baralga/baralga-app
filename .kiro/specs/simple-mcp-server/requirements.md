# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides time tracking functionality. The MCP server will expose a set of tools for managing time entries and generating basic reports, allowing external applications to integrate time tracking capabilities through the MCP protocol. The server will provide CRUD operations for time entries and basic reporting functions to summarize tracked time by various dimensions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an MCP-compatible application, I want to create time entries with start/end times, descriptions, and project associations, so that I can track my work activities programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `create_entry` tool THEN the system SHALL create a new time entry with the provided start time, end time, description, and project
2. WHEN creating an entry THEN the system SHALL validate that the end time is after the start time
3. WHEN creating an entry THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the entry
4. WHEN creating an entry with missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating which fields are required
5. WHEN creating an entry successfully THEN the system SHALL return the created entry with its assigned ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve specific time entries by their ID, so that I can access detailed information about individual time tracking records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `get_entry` tool with a valid entry ID THEN the system SHALL return the complete entry details including ID, start time, end time, description, and project
2. WHEN I call the `get_entry` tool with an invalid or non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the entry was not found
3. WHEN retrieving an entry THEN the system SHALL return all stored fields for that entry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update existing time entries, so that I can correct mistakes or add additional information to previously tracked time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `update_entry` tool with a valid entry ID and updated fields THEN the system SHALL modify the specified fields of the existing entry
2. WHEN updating an entry THEN the system SHALL validate that any new end time is after the start time
3. WHEN updating an entry with an invalid ID THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the entry was not found
4. WHEN updating an entry successfully THEN the system SHALL return the updated entry with all current field values
5. WHEN updating an entry THEN the system SHALL preserve any fields that are not specified in the update request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to delete time entries, so that I can remove incorrect or unwanted time tracking records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `delete_entry` tool with a valid entry ID THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the entry from storage
2. WHEN deleting an entry with an invalid or non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the entry was not found
3. WHEN deleting an entry successfully THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation message
4. WHEN attempting to retrieve a deleted entry THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the entry no longer exists

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to list time entries with optional filtering by date range and project, so that I can retrieve relevant subsets of time tracking data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `list_entries` tool without filters THEN the system SHALL return all time entries in the system
2. WHEN I call the `list_entries` tool with a from date THEN the system SHALL return only entries with start times on or after the specified date
3. WHEN I call the `list_entries` tool with a to date THEN the system SHALL return only entries with start times on or before the specified date
4. WHEN I call the `list_entries` tool with both from and to dates THEN the system SHALL return entries within the specified date range
5. WHEN I call the `list_entries` tool with a project filter THEN the system SHALL return only entries associated with the specified project
6. WHEN combining date and project filters THEN the system SHALL return entries that match all specified criteria
7. WHEN no entries match the specified filters THEN the system SHALL return an empty list

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get time summaries for specified periods, so that I can understand total time tracked across different time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `get_summary` tool with a period type (day/week/month/quarter/year) and date THEN the system SHALL calculate and return the total hours for that period
2. WHEN calculating a daily summary THEN the system SHALL include all entries that start within the specified day
3. WHEN calculating a weekly summary THEN the system SHALL include all entries that start within the specified week (Monday to Sunday)
4. WHEN calculating a monthly summary THEN the system SHALL include all entries that start within the specified month
5. WHEN calculating a quarterly summary THEN the system SHALL include all entries that start within the specified quarter
6. WHEN calculating a yearly summary THEN the system SHALL include all entries that start within the specified year
7. WHEN no entries exist for the specified period THEN the system SHALL return zero hours
8. WHEN calculating summaries THEN the system SHALL return the total duration in hours with appropriate precision

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to get hours grouped by project for a date range, so that I can analyze time allocation across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `get_hours_by_project` tool with a date range THEN the system SHALL return total hours grouped by project for entries within that range
2. WHEN calculating project hours THEN the system SHALL include all entries with start times within the specified date range
3. WHEN entries exist for multiple projects THEN the system SHALL return separate totals for each project
4. WHEN entries exist without a project association THEN the system SHALL group them under a default category (e.g., "Unassigned")
5. WHEN no entries exist in the specified date range THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set
6. WHEN calculating project totals THEN the system SHALL return hours with appropriate precision for each project

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve a list of all available projects with their unique identifiers, so that I can reference valid projects when creating or filtering time entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the `list_projects` tool THEN the system SHALL return all projects available in the system
2. WHEN listing projects THEN the system SHALL include both the project name and its unique UUID for each project
3. WHEN no projects exist in the system THEN the system SHALL return an empty list
4. WHEN listing projects THEN the system SHALL return projects in a consistent order (e.g., alphabetical by name)
5. WHEN listing projects THEN the system SHALL include all active projects that can be associated with time entries
