# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Organization Name Dialog
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement a small dialog in the navbar that allows users to view and edit their organization name. The dialog will be accessible from the navbar above the logout option, with read-only access for normal users and edit capability for users with ROLE_ADMIN role.

## User Stories

### Organization Name Management

As an organization administrator, I want to edit my organization's name from the navbar, so that I can keep the organization information up-to-date without navigating to a separate settings page.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Admin user clicks on organization name or settings icon in navbar
2. Dialog opens showing current organization name in an input field
3. Admin can edit the name and save changes
4. Dialog closes and navbar reflects the updated organization name
5. For regular users, the dialog shows read-only organization name

### Organization Name Viewing

As a regular user, I want to view my organization's name from the navbar, so that I can see which organization I'm currently working in.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User clicks on organization name or settings icon in navbar
2. Dialog opens showing current organization name in read-only format
3. User can view the name but cannot edit it
4. User closes dialog to return to main interface

## Spec Scope

1. **Navbar Organization Dialog** - Add a clickable element in the navbar that opens a modal dialog for organization name management
2. **Role-based Access Control** - Implement read-only access for ROLE_USER and edit access for ROLE_ADMIN
3. **Organization Name Display** - Show current organization name in the dialog with appropriate input field styling
4. **Dialog Interaction** - Implement modal dialog with open/close functionality using existing Bootstrap components
5. **Form Validation** - Basic validation for organization name input (non-empty, reasonable length)

## Out of Scope

- API endpoints for organization name updates (web-only implementation)
- Organization name change history or audit logging
- Bulk organization management features
- Organization settings beyond name editing
- Email notifications for organization name changes

## Expected Deliverable

1. A functional dialog accessible from the navbar that displays the current organization name
2. Role-based access control where ROLE_ADMIN users can edit the name and ROLE_USER users see read-only view
3. Successful organization name updates that persist and are reflected in the navbar display
4. Proper form validation and user feedback for organization name changes
