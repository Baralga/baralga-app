# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a small dialog in the navbar that allows users to view and edit their organization name. The dialog will be accessible from the navbar above the logout option, with read-only access for normal users and edit capability for users with ROLE_ADMIN role. This provides a convenient way for administrators to manage organization information directly from the main interface without navigating to separate settings pages.
